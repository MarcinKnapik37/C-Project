# C-Project

This is my first project written in C++

In order to play, you have to download the whole folder, and then run 

$ make
$ ./game.e

Have fun!

fix: appearently you also have to download SFML libraries by running something like $ sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Angry Slime's fists is a simple 2D arcade game.
It utilizes SFML library.

Basically what you have to do is reach teleport,
while avoiding all the nasty spiders! Fortunalety
you are not helpless against those creatures!

Keep track of your money balance. Coins allow
you to open silver gates, that can lead you
to the further lovcations.

You can collect fireballs, each of which can kill
exactly one spider.

Game also features wooden boxes! You can 
slide those (but not more than one at a time)
to shelter yourself from enemies or just to 
find passage to the next lexvel.

Also did I mention that spiders are quite
clever? They will track you down using BFS
algorithm!

Game experience is enchanced by cool sounds,
like for example collecting coin or getting
eaten by spider!

Textures (and animations) were created
all by myself.

Game runs just couple frames, to help sustain
game logic, but hopefully this won't make your
experience with game worse.

Have fun!
